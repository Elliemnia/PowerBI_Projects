# "Taxi Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI"
My project involves cleaning data from a large CSV file, using DAX and M language in Power BI to calculate taxi passenger usage over a period of time, and creating a dashboard and report to visualize the data.
This project calculates average revenue per date range, analyzes weekday usage, and presents the number of passengers accessing taxis per day in the dashboard and report.
I used Power BI, DAX, and M language for data analysis and visualization.
